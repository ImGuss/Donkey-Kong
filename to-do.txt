---- make it a moving sprite instead of always facing in one direction ----

var princessCont  asdf  ?  asdf  : cfds

^^^^ maybe



make an object that has an array of position
then when the princess is left it changes the position of the sprite based on if it's going left or right

example

princess = {


  this.spritePosition = [0, 0, 32, 32],
}

if (left) {
  peach.spritePosition = [32, 32, 32, 32]
} else if (right) {
  peach.spritePosition = [0, 0, 32, 32]
}

oooor you can change the specific index
